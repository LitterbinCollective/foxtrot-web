## Introduction
This document (the "Privacy Policy") describes the **information collected through the use of
**foxtrot** (the "Discord Bot") and **foxtrot.litterbin.dev** (the "Website")** (the "Data"), its storage,
and the measures taken to protect it.

By using the Discord Bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Please note: This document should be read in conjunction with our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms-of-service).

## Definitions
- **Litterbin Collective** ("us", "we" or "our") refers to the organization that operates both the Discord
Bot and the Website.
- The **"Platform"** refers to Discord, where the Bot operates.
- The **"Server"** refers to any Discord server where the Bot is used.

## Information Collected
The Discord Bot collects the following information when it is invited to a server or interacted with:
- **Server-specific data**: Server ID, name, and member count;
- **Channel-specific data**: Channel ID and name;
- **User-specific data** *(only during error events)*: User ID, username, and discriminator;
- **Message-specific data** *(only during error events)*: Message ID, timestamp (created and edited), and content.

This data is collected only when you interact with the Bot, such as by executing a command. Specifically,
message and user data are only collected when a command results in an error and is required for debugging
purposes.

We do **not** collect any personal or identifiable data through the Website. No server-side logs or tracking
mechanisms are implemented when a user accesses or retrieves data from the Website.

## Data Access
Access to the Data is restricted to Litterbin Collective administrators and trusted personnel with SSH
access, and is solely used for development and maintenance purposes. The Data is never sold or shared with
third parties, except as required by the Platform or applicable law.

## Data Storage
The Data is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database. We implement protective measures to prevent
unauthorized external access. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security and assume no liability in the
event of a breach. In such cases, affected users may be notified.

## Your Rights
If you are the owner of a Server where the Bot is used, or a user whose data has been collected as a result
of a command runtime error, you have the right to request access to the Data associated with you or your
Server, or to request its removal. Please refer to the Contact section below for instructions on how to
submit such requests.

## Underage Users
Use of the Discord Bot is not permitted for users under the age of 13, in accordance with Discord’s Terms of
Service and the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## External Links
The Website and the Discord Bot may contain links to third-party services not operated by us. We are not
responsible for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party services.

## Contact
