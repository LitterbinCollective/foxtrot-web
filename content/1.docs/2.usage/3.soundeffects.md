# sound effects
to play sound effects use `sfx` command.

sound effects are stored on separate repositories:
```js
      'PAC3-Server/chatsounds-valve-games',
      'Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds',
      'PAC3-Server/chatsounds',
      'LitterbinCollective/foxtrot-chatsounds',
```

## syntax
the syntax of a sound effect script is based off newchatsounds syntax.
it should be also mentioned that it also supports modifiers, including
legacy ones.

to use a modifier on a sound effect, type colon after the sound effect,
the name of the modifier and, if necessary, the arguments separated by
a comma wrapped in parentheses.

to use a legacy modifier, type it after the sound effect and then specify
an argument.

## examples
`helloooo:lfopitch` - adds LFO pitch modifier (vibrato) to the `helloooo` sound effect.<br>
`helloooo:pitch(0.7)` - lowers the pitch of `helloooo` sound effect to 70%.<br>
`helloooo=0.5 overused thud` - plays `helloooo` sound effect, then after 0.5 seconds overlays `overused thud`.
