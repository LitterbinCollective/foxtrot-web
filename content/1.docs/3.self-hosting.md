::alert{type="danger"}
‚ùó do whatever you want with foxtrot's source code, just stay in line with AGPL-2.0
::

## prerequisites
::list{type="info"}
- Git
- Node.js
- [C++ build tools](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
- FFmpeg
- SOX
- PostgreSQL server (for production)
::

PostgreSQL server is not needed, because on `development` environment it uses SQLite3, however it
is recommended that you set it up because running things on a `development` environment is generally
a bad practice.

## setting up
clone `foxtrot.ts` repository into the workspace and install dependencies.
:terminal{content="git clone https://github.com/LitterbinCollective/foxtrot.ts.git && cd foxtrot.ts/ && npm install"}

## configuration
configure the application using `*.example.json` files in the `configs/` directory as a template.

`formats.json` is unused, and you may leave it empty:
```json
{}
```

### `app.json` fields
::alert{type="info"}
ü´† shard config variables will not be described in detail.
::
::alert{type="warning"}
‚ö†Ô∏è all of these fields need to be in their supposed types (just as in the example). otherwise, TypeScript code will not compile.

| name | description | required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `token`           | Discord bot token.                                                                                                                     | yes |
| `prefix`          | default message-content-based prefix.                                                                                                  | yes |
| `proxy`           | HTTPS proxy. if you do not have one, leave it empty: `""`.                                                                             | no  |
| `feedbackWebhook` | feedback webhook. it is also used to report any cluster crashes. you need to extract the ID and the token of the webhook from its URL. | yes |
| `devId`           | owner/runner user ID on Discord. it is used only to ping the user on cluster crashes.                                                  | yes |
| `shardCount`      | set it to `1`.                                                                                                                         | yes |
| `shardStart`      | set it to `0`.                                                                                                                         | yes |
| `shardEnd`        | set it to `1`.                                                                                                                         | yes |

### configuring `shat.json`
the only thing that you need to specify here is the `gitHubToken` field. everything else does not need to be modified.

go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a new token, then put it into the `gitHubToken` variable.

creating a separate repository for sound effects (or otherwise chatsounds) will not be described in detail, however if
you would like to use your own chatsounds GitHub repository with foxtrot, add an object to `sources`, templated to the
following structure:
```json
    // author/repository-name#branch
    "Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds#master": {
      // bases (array of paths)
      "bases": ["sound/chatsounds/autoadd"],

      // if you somehow managed to create a msgpack file for chatsounds
      "useMsgPack": false
    },
```

### configuring Knex
create a user and a database in the PostgreSQL server if you have not done it already.

in the root of the project, copy `knexfile.example.ts` to `knexfile.ts` and configure it.

after configuring, you need to run migrations. to do that, you need to run the following:
:terminal{content="npx knex migrate:latest"}

### configuring Spotify
if needed, you may add support for Spotify by following these instructions:
1. extract client ID and private key with https://github.com/wvdumper/dumper.
2. extract cookies (in Netscape format) from open.spotify.com while being logged in.
3. put these files into `configs/` folder and name them accordingly:
  * Widevine client ID: `widevine_client_id.bin`
  * Widevine device private key: `widevine_private_key.pem`
  * cookies: `spotify_cookies.txt`

if the needed files are missing, Spotify as a format will not be considered
supported by foxtrot.

## almost done
build the application, including the C++ audio mixer.
:terminal{content="npm run build"}

to run it under production, you need to set `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` and then just run
`npm run start`.
